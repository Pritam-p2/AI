used CNN to recognise digits using mnist dataset.
Tried YOLO and Tensorflow to do the same work using my own dataset.
I remember my motive was to make a flask app that uses CV to intake live video as inputs from mobile camera. Detecting the numbers and adding them
this was something I wanted to make. Although I could not acheive good accuracy with yolo and tensor flow models. I believe my dataset was small so it didnot work so well.
